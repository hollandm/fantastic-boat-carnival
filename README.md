Battleship Game Simulator &amp; AI

One of my first ever computer science projects/course projects was making Battleship for Android. I was quite proud of the project but I don't own a compatible android device anymore so I remade it. This lacks some of the fancy ship drawings and neat sound effects... but close enough.

To run this project run src/Model/Game.java

Edit the main function in Game.java to swap out the player types. You can enable/disable the Heuristic AI GUI display in src/Brains/HeuristicAI.java but I think it is neat so I'm going to leave it enabled.
